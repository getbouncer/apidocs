## Using CardScan (React Native)

**Check device support**

```javascript
import Cardscan from 'react-native-cardscan';

Cardscan.isSupportedAsync()
  .then(supported => {
    if (supported) {
      // YES, show scan button
    } else {
      // NO
    }
  })
```

**Scan card**

```javascript
import Cardscan from 'react-native-cardscan';

Cardscan.scan()
  .then(({ action, payload }) => {
    if (action === 'scanned') {
      const { number, expiryMonth, expiryYear } = payload;
      // Display information
    } else if (action === 'cancelled') {
      // User cancelled
    } else if (action === 'skipped') {
      // User skipped
    }
  })
```

## Troubleshooting

##### `ld: warning: Could not find auto-linked library 'swiftFoundation'`
* A workaround with XCode 11 is to add a bridge header https://stackoverflow.com/a/56176956

##### `error: Failed to build iOS project. We ran "xcodebuild" command but it exited with error code 65`
* A workaround with a newer XCode build system is to switch to the legacy build https://stackoverflow.com/a/51089264
