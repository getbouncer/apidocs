# React native integration guide

## Installation

### 1. Install the CardScan SDK into your app

#### iOS

Install and setup permission [cardscan-ios](https://github.com/getbouncer/cardscan-ios#installation)

#### Android

No additional steps are necessary to install [cardscan-android](https://github.com/getbouncer/cardscan-android#installation).

### 2. Install the [react-native-cardscan](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-cardscan) package from NPM

```text
$ npm install react-native-cardscan
```

### 3. For RN 0.59 and below: Link native dependencies

#### Automatic

```text
$ react-native link react-native-cardscan
```

#### Manual

**iOS**

1. In XCode, in the project navigator, right click `Libraries` ➜ `Add Files to [your project's name]`
2. Go to `node_modules` ➜ `react-native-cardscan` and add `RNCardscan.xcodeproj`
3. In XCode, in the project navigator, select your project. Add `libRNCardscan.a` to your project's `Build Phases` ➜ `Link Binary With Libraries`
4. Run your project `Cmd+R`

**Android**

1. Insert the following lines inside the dependencies block in `android/app/build.gradle`:

   ```text
   implementation project(':react-native-cardscan')
   ```

2. Append the following lines to `android/settings.gradle`:

   ```text
   include ':react-native-cardscan'
   project(':react-native-cardscan').projectDir = new File(rootProject.projectDir, '../node_modules/react-native-cardscan/android')
   ```

3. Open `android/app/src/main/java/[...]/MainApplication.java`
   * Add `import com.getbouncer.RNCardscanPackage;` to the imports at the top of the file
   * Add `new RNCardscanPackage()` to the list returned by the `getPackages()` method

### Configure CardScan SDK

#### iOS

Install and setup permission for CardScan iOS with directions [here](https://github.com/getbouncer/cardscan-ios#installation)

Also, the instructions to configure your API key in Obj-C is [here](https://github.com/getbouncer/cardscan-ios#configure-cardscan-objective-c)

The podfile in your `~/ios/Podfile` in your project should look similar to:

```bash
platform :ios, '10.0'
  target 'Your App' do
  ...
  pod 'CardScan'
  pod 'react-native-cardscan', :path => '../node_modules/react-native-cardscan/react-native-cardscan.podspec'
end
```

#### Android

To configure your [API key](https://api.getbouncer.com/console), open up `android/app/src/main/java/[...]/MainApplication.java` and add the following

```java
import com.getbouncer.RNCardscanModule;
...

...
public void onCreate() {
  ...
  RNCardscanModule.apiKey = "";
  RNCardscanModule.enableNameExtraction = false; // set to true for experimental name extraction
}
```

## Using CardScan \(React Native\)

**Check device support**

```java
import Cardscan from 'react-native-cardscan';

Cardscan.isSupportedAsync()
  .then(supported => {
    if (supported) {
      // YES, show scan button
    } else {
      // NO
    }
  })
```

**Scan card**

```java
import Cardscan from 'react-native-cardscan';

Cardscan.scan()
  .then(({action, payload, canceled_reason}) => {
    if (action === 'scanned') {
      const { number, expiryMonth, expiryYear, issuer, legalName } = payload;
      // Display information
    } else if (action === 'canceled') {
      if (canceled_reason === 'enter_card_manually') {
        // the user elected to enter a card manually
      } else if (canceled_reason === 'camera_error') {
        // there was an error with the camera
      } else if (canceled_reason === 'fatal_error') {
        // there was an error during the scan
      } else if (canceled_reason === 'user_canceled') {
        // the user canceled the scan
      } else {
        // the scan was canceled for an unknown reason
      }
    } else if (action === 'skipped') {
      // User skipped
    } else if (action === 'unknown') {
      // Unknown reason for scan canceled
    }
  })
```

## Example app

Inside `example`, you can find an example React Native project that you can run.

To run the example app, do the following:

* Navigate to `example`
* `npm install`
* Update API key in `android/app/src/main/java/com/example/MainApplication.java` for Android and `ios/example/AppDelegate.m` for iOS.
* Point the android app to the SDK: create a file `example/android/local.properties` with a line

  ```text
  sdk.dir=
  ```

* To run Android app: `react-native run-android`
* To run iOS app: `react-native run-ios`

## Troubleshooting

**ld: warning: Could not find auto-linked library 'swiftFoundation'**

* A workaround with XCode 11 is to add a bridge header [https://stackoverflow.com/a/56176956](https://stackoverflow.com/a/56176956)

**error: Failed to build iOS project. We ran "xcodebuild" command but it exited with error code 65**

* A workaround with a newer XCode build system is to switch to the legacy build [https://stackoverflow.com/a/51089264](https://stackoverflow.com/a/51089264)
