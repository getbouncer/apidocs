# Integration overview

### Role of the **Bouncer Mobile SDKs:**

* Scan the number side of a card
* Enable users to enter CVV and ZIP codes to finish a scanned card entry
* Enable users to enter all card details
* Track and log signals about the device and user, and send these signals back to Bouncer
* Return an "authentication payload" that the server can use to verify that a card was authentic when the user added it to the app.

**Note:** The Bouncer SDK will not directly expose whether this was a legitimate scan of a real card to the client App. Itâ€™ll be up to the client App to make a subsequent server-to-server call to get the authentication results.

### **Role of the Bouncer Server:**

* Verify the authentication payload generated by the Bouncer mobile SDK and return results of the authentication assessment
* Endpoints
  * `/v1/card/authenticate`\(server-to-server\): Processes the payload and returns a authentication token
  * `/v1/token/validate` \(server-to-server\): Returns the result of the card authentication assessment
