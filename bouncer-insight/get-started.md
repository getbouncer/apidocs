  Bouncer Insight is a risk score for your users and transactions. It works by
  instrumenting your app to detect suspicious behavior, and then provides a risk
  score for your transactions.

# Get started

In your app, where users add credit cards, instrument your "add a card" flow, and we'll authenticate the payment method, independent of how your users prefer to enter card details.

At checkout, send a "card authentication payload" to Bouncer's servers and we'll give you a fraud score for that card and the ability to [forced-verify cards](../bouncer-scan/verifying-high-risk-cards/) if you detect anything suspicious.
